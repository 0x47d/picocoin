Running tests with valgrind:

	make check TESTS_ENVIRONMENT=valgrind

or

	make check TESTS_ENVIRONMENT='libtool --mode=execute valgrind --error-exitcode=1'

The following environment variables make GLib much more valgrind-friendly:

	G_SLICE=always-malloc

		or

	G_DEBUG=gc-friendly G_SLICE=always-malloc

It is recommended to build OpenSSL with -DPURIFY to eliminate lots of
valgrind noise.

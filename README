Dependencies:
	GLib 2.x (from the GTK project)

Command line and configuration file usage
=========================================

In general, the program stores settings in a key/value map.  These key=value
parameters may be specified on the command line, or in a configuration file.

The command line is processed first, then the configuration file is read.  The
entries are processed in order, overwriting any existing duplicates.

Once configuration has been read, execution begins.


Recognized parameters

config (alias "c")
------------------
Specify a pathname to the configuration file.

list-settings
-------------
Display settings map.

dns-seeds
---------
